<h1 id="how-i-coach">How I Coach</h1>

<p>Coaching is a great place to develop yourself because it&rsquo;s not a typical employer-employee relationship. It&rsquo;s a relationship that you and I design together. Most importantly, I get to be here for your growth, with no conflicting incentives. As we get to know each other, the coaching relationship becomes a stronger container for that growth.</p>

<p>Coaching is a practice that specializes in changing awareness and action, so we can change the world around us.</p>

<p>As a coach I&rsquo;m hoping to evoke an insight. Not a new idea, but a new way of seeing or operating in the world.</p>

<p>Every coaching engagement is different. Most of our work will happen in these three areas, and we&rsquo;ll often move between them in a session:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overcoming a challenge or moving through a transition<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you&rsquo;re noticing that what for you worked before, isn&rsquo;t working anymore. You know you want to change. I help you develop a commitment to your change, and to run experiments in a new direction. Experiments that may be difficult or awkward at first, but that can become second nature with practice.</p>

<p>Coaching isn&rsquo;t just about getting through a challenge alive. It&rsquo;s about the opportunity for growth that lives within the challenge. Often this opportunity will require you to let go of something that has been difficult for you to part with. An old habit or way that you&rsquo;re used to feeling valued. Letting go makes space for new approaches and perspectives to emerge.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improving specific skills</li>
</ul>

<p>Some clients show up with a desire to, say, improve their their ability to have difficult conversations, articulate their feelings more clearly, improve their presentation skills, or listen deeply. We can practice together and I can help you prep for an opportunity in your work life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Listening, reflecting, and identifying patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>Listening is a huge component of coaching. I make space for you. That space uncovers the deeper values, unconscious patterns, and motivations that drive you. Getting clarity on <em>why</em> you want what you want makes day-to-day decisionmaking much easier. I help you bring unconscious patterns into the light, where we can work with them.</p>
