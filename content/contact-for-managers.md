title: Nerd coaching for managers
draft: true
---

Going from an individual contributor role into management is more than just a professional shift. It’s a personal change in mindset and that can take several years. Tragically, a lot of new managers are thrown into the situation practically overnight, with insufficient support. Management doesn’t always have the time to coach new managers. Or, in a hypergrowth company, the management organization may be underwater and unable to support individuals on the path. My coaching will help fill in the gaps and set you up for success.
