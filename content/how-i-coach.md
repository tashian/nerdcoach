## How I Coach
Coaching is a practice that specializes in changing awareness and action, so we can change the world around us.

Coaching is a great place to develop yourself because it's not a typical employer-employee relationship. It's a relationship that you and I design together. Most importantly, I get to be here for your growth, with no conflicting incentives. As we get to know each other, the coaching relationship becomes a stronger container for that growth.

As a coach I'm hoping to evoke an insight. Not a new idea, but a new way of seeing or operating in the world.

Every coaching engagement is different. Here's a few common areas where I can help:

* Overcoming a challenge or moving through a transition  

For example, you're noticing that what for you worked before, isn't working anymore. You know you want to change. I help you develop a commitment to your change, and to run experiments in a new direction. Experiments that may be difficult or awkward at first, but that can become second nature with practice.  

Coaching isn't just about getting through the challenge alive. It's about the opportunity for growth that lives within any challenge.

* Improving specific skills

Some clients show up with a desire to, say, improve their coaching skills or their ability to have difficult conversations. We can practice together and I can help you prep for an opportunity in your work life.

* Listening, reflecting, and identifying patterns

Listening is a huge component of coaching. I make space for you, and in that space we're able to see some patterns, motivations, and opportunities for growth. I help you bring unconscious patterns into the light, where we can work with them.
