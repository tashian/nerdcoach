  <h2>I'm Carl Tashian, and I'm a nerd coach in San Francisco.</h2>

I'm here to help you become a more confident and effective leader. To develop the tools to do your best work, to uncover blind spots, and to do the challenging but important work of growing as a leader.

I've been in startups since I was in high school, as a Software Engineer in the early days of Zipcar and more recently as VP of Engineering and co-founder at Yerdle. I've had the sleepless nights. I've had to learn how to maintain my sanity while underwater, and how to make my way back to the surface. Along the way, I've been lucky enough to work with amazing mentors.

I've mentored founders at Code for America and Singularity U, and I've coached engineering managers at Google and Pivotal. I'm also an avid meditator, and I have seen first hand how important deep self-inquiry is for leadership. I want to help you become a better leader, manager, human, and nerd.
